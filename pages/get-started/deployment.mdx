# Introduction Deployment

The Deployment section for OpenShift provides a structured framework for planning, implementing, and enabling Red Hat OpenShift as the foundation of our cloud-native platforms. OpenShift is more than just a container orchestration tool—it is an enterprise-grade platform that brings together Kubernetes, security, automation, and developer productivity features into a single solution. This documentation is intended to help teams deliver OpenShift deployments that are reliable, scalable, and aligned with the business goals of our clients.

## Purpose of OpenShift Deployment Documentation

Deploying OpenShift is not a one-size-fits-all exercise. Every client environment comes with unique requirements related to infrastructure, compliance, workloads, and organizational maturity. The purpose of this documentation is to provide:

- **Methodologies and best practices** for setting up OpenShift clusters across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments.  
- **Guidance on deployment models** that balance performance, security, and scalability.  
- **Structured processes** for minimizing risks and ensuring smooth handovers from deployment to operations.  
- **Enablement pathways** that help client teams quickly adopt the platform.  

By following these guidelines, we ensure that OpenShift deployments are consistent, future-proof, and capable of supporting mission-critical workloads.

## Deployment Architecture

Before starting any deployment, it is essential to define the architecture that fits the client’s use case. Typical considerations include:

- **Control Plane and Worker Nodes** – Sizing based on workload requirements, resilience needs, and expected growth.  
- **Networking** – Configuring SDN/OVN, ingress controllers, and load balancers to ensure secure and performant traffic flows.  
- **Storage** – Integrating persistent storage providers that support stateful applications.  
- **Security** – Implementing RBAC, network policies, and identity management from day one.  
- **Integration** – Ensuring compatibility with monitoring, logging, and CI/CD pipelines.  

Every deployment starts with an **architecture assessment** to map these requirements into a concrete design.

## Deployment Models

OpenShift can be deployed in multiple environments, depending on the client’s infrastructure and strategic priorities:

- **On-Premises** – Full control over infrastructure with enhanced security and compliance, ideal for organizations with strict data residency requirements.  
- **Cloud** – Fully managed OpenShift services (such as ROSA or ARO) that reduce operational overhead and accelerate time-to-market.  
- **Hybrid** – A combination of on-premises and cloud environments that balance flexibility, cost, and compliance.  
- **Edge** – Lightweight deployments at the edge of the network, enabling real-time processing and low-latency applications.  

Each model has distinct advantages, and part of the deployment process is helping clients choose the right one for their needs.

## Deployment Strategies

To minimize risks and ensure seamless adoption, we use proven deployment strategies:

- **Blue-Green Deployment** – Running parallel environments to achieve zero downtime during migration or upgrades.  
- **Rolling Updates** – Gradually updating nodes and workloads with minimal disruption.  
- **Canary Releases** – Deploying new features to a small subset of users before scaling across the platform.  
- **Automated Provisioning** – Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Ansible and Terraform to ensure repeatable and auditable deployments.  

These strategies provide flexibility and allow teams to balance speed with stability.

## Advanced Platform Capabilities

OpenShift deployments can be extended with advanced capabilities that enhance security, governance, and multi-cluster management:

- **Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (ACM)** – For centralized lifecycle management across multiple clusters and environments.  
- **Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS)** – To enforce security policies, detect vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance.  
- **Service Mesh** – For microservices traffic management, observability, and resilience.  
- **OpenShift Virtualization** – To run virtual machines alongside containers, enabling platform consolidation and VMware migration scenarios.  

These components should be considered early in the design process to ensure long-term scalability and governance.

## Deployment Process

A standard OpenShift deployment typically follows these phases:

1. **Assessment and Planning** – Gathering requirements, assessing current infrastructure, and defining success criteria.  
2. **Architecture Design** – Documenting control plane, nodes, storage, networking, and integrations.  
3. **Platform Setup** – Installing OpenShift clusters with automation tools and validated configurations.  
4. **Integration** – Connecting with identity providers, CI/CD pipelines, observability tools, and security systems.  
5. **Validation and Testing** – Running performance, failover, and compliance tests before production rollout.  
6. **Handover and Enablement** – Training client teams, transferring knowledge, and providing operational playbooks.  

This process ensures deployments are transparent, predictable, and repeatable across client engagements.

## Collaboration with Clients

Successful OpenShift deployments depend on close collaboration between our teams and the client’s stakeholders. Key principles include:

- **Joint planning sessions** to align on scope and expectations.  
- **Shared documentation and playbooks** to avoid knowledge silos.  
- **Enablement workshops** that prepare client teams to operate the platform independently.  
- **Feedback loops** that ensure deployment lessons are integrated into future projects.  

By working in partnership, we ensure long-term adoption and success beyond the initial deployment.

## Continuous Improvement

OpenShift is a living platform that evolves with new features, updates, and ecosystem tools. Our deployment practices must evolve alongside it. Teams are encouraged to update this documentation with lessons learned, automation improvements, and integration patterns that enhance future deployments.

This Deployment – OpenShift section provides the foundation for how we deliver secure, scalable, and future-ready platforms. By combining architectural rigor, proven strategies, and close collaboration with clients, we ensure that OpenShift is not just deployed—but successfully adopted as the backbone of enterprise cloud-native initiatives.
