# Introduction Resources

The Resources section serves as the central knowledge hub for all teams working with cloud-native platforms and OpenShift. While Sales, Deployment, and Operations provide structured processes and practices, Resources brings everything together by offering supporting materials that are reusable, adaptable, and always accessible. This section is designed to save time, reduce duplication of effort, and ensure that our teams have immediate access to the right information, templates, and tools whenever they need them.

## Purpose of the Resources Documentation

Resources exist to make knowledge practical and actionable. Instead of reinventing processes or searching across multiple sources, teams can rely on this section as a **single point of reference**. It includes:

- **Templates** that standardize documents, proposals, and technical deliverables.  
- **Guides and Playbooks** that provide step-by-step instructions for recurring activities.  
- **Checklists** that ensure consistency and compliance in critical processes.  
- **Reference Materials** including external links, documentation, and knowledge bases.  
- **Learning Resources** to support continuous professional development and skill-building.  

By centralizing these materials, we improve collaboration across teams and accelerate the pace of work.

## Types of Resources

### Templates
Standardized templates help maintain consistency in how we document, present, and deliver solutions. Examples include:  
- Sales proposal templates.  
- Deployment architecture diagrams and documentation formats.  
- Operations playbooks and incident postmortem reports.  
- Security assessment and compliance check templates.  

### Guides and Playbooks

- Step-by-step OpenShift cluster installation and configuration.  
- Incident response procedures.  
- Security hardening and patch management.  
- CI/CD pipeline integration with OpenShift.  

### Checklists
Checklists ensure that important steps are never missed. They provide clarity and accountability. Examples include:  
- Pre-deployment readiness checklists.  
- Security compliance checklists.  
- Monitoring and observability setup checklists.  
- Go-live and handover checklists.  

### Reference Materials
This includes curated references to both internal and external knowledge bases:  
- Official Red Hat OpenShift documentation.
