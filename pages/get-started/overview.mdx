# Overview

Welcome to the **Cloud Native Internal Documentation**.  
This section is designed to provide a structured introduction to the way we work, the technologies we use, and the practices we follow across teams. It serves as a foundation for onboarding new colleagues, aligning existing teams, and ensuring consistent quality in everything we deliver.  

---

## Purpose of This Documentation

The **Get Started** section aims to:

- Offer a **clear orientation** for new team members who need to quickly understand our environment.  
- Provide **standardized guidelines** for deployment, operations, platform engineering, and client-facing activities.  
- Establish a **single source of truth** for processes, tools, and references, reducing the need for ad-hoc explanations.  
- Enable **cross-team collaboration** by making knowledge accessible and transparent.

## What You Will Find Here

The content is structured into five key areas:  

### 1. Sales  
Guidelines, narratives, and positioning strategies that help us communicate the value of cloud-native solutions to clients. This includes sales playbooks, messaging frameworks, and reference case studies.  

### 2. Deployment  
Step-by-step instructions and best practices for deploying platforms and tools such as **OpenShift, Kubernetes, Ansible**, and other related technologies. This section also covers different deployment models (on-premises, cloud, hybrid, edge) and recommended strategies (blue-green, rolling updates, canary).  

### 3. Platform  
A dedicated section for **platform engineering** and the internal developer platform (IDP) approach. This area explains how we design, build, and operate cloud-native platforms that serve as a foundation for product teams.  
Key topics include:  
- Principles of platform engineering  
- Designing Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)  
- Self-service workflows for developers  
- Integration with CI/CD, observability, and security pipelines  
- Governance, compliance, and cost optimization  

### 4. Operations  
Operational standards for **monitoring, observability, security, and incident management**. Here you will also find runbooks, escalation procedures, and practices for maintaining system reliability and performance in production environments.  

### 5. Resources  
A central place for **templates, checklists, training materials, and external references**. This section ensures that every team member has quick access to curated, reliable, and up-to-date resources.
