# Scaling & Performance

Ensuring that the platform can handle workloads under varying demand is essential for reliability and user satisfaction.

## Horizontal and Vertical Scaling
Applications and infrastructure can scale horizontally (adding nodes/pods) or vertically (increasing resources per node). Kubernetes supports both approaches.

## Autoscaling
Cluster Autoscaler and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) dynamically adjust resources based on demand. This ensures efficient utilization without overprovisioning.

## Performance Tuning
Fine-tuning workloads, networking, and storage settings improves responsiveness. Benchmarking helps validate performance against SLAs.

## Cost Optimization
Scaling should balance performance and cost. Right-sizing clusters and using reserved cloud resources optimize spending.
