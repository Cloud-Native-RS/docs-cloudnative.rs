# Messaging & Differentiation

OpenShift should be positioned not as “just another Kubernetes”, but as a **strategic enterprise platform**.  

## Messaging by Stakeholder  

- **Executives / Business Leaders**  
  - Focus on agility, ROI, digital transformation.  
  - Emphasize reduced vendor lock-in and faster innovation.  

- **IT Managers**  
  - Highlight consistency across on-prem and cloud.  
  - Stress security, compliance, and automation with Ansible.  

- **Developers / Engineers**  
  - Focus on developer experience: CI/CD, GitOps, self-service.  
  - Showcase integration with modern frameworks and tooling.  

## Competitive Differentiation  
- vs. **DIY Kubernetes**: OpenShift offers enterprise features out-of-the-box, reducing integration effort.  
- vs. **VMware Tanzu**: Stronger community, ecosystem, and proven migration paths.  
- vs. **Public Cloud Managed K8s (EKS/AKS/GKE)**: Hybrid & multi-cloud flexibility with consistent governance.
