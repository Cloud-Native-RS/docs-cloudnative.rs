Orgnized company in modern enterprise solutions, expanding our operations beyond Serbia to other European and global markets.

## Digital Transformation

### Challenges in the Transformation Process

Today’s business depends on the speed of application and service delivery. Customers expect rapid adaptation to market changes and simplified processes, which poses challenges for development teams and managers.

Traditional industries, like banks, have stable IT systems that may not evolve functionally or integrate easily with other systems, creating competitive disadvantages against agile startups using cloud-native technologies.

### What is Cloud-Native?

Cloud-native architecture is an approach designed to fully leverage cloud technology. It consists of three main elements: containers, container orchestration, and microservices. Cultural, process, and operational changes within the company are also essential.

#### Containers

Containers package everything needed to run an application in a single executable unit, independent of the environment. Docker is the most widely known container technology.

#### Orchestration

Container orchestration automates management and deployment of containers with real-time load balancing. Kubernetes is the standard for orchestration.

#### Microservices

Cloud-native apps consist of small services performing single functions, connected only as necessary, enabling faster development and horizontal scaling.

### Benefits of Cloud-Native Approach

- **Time to Market:** Faster release of new services gives a competitive advantage.  
- **Productivity:** Quick access to infrastructure reduces waiting times from weeks to minutes.  
- **Transparent Costs:** Reduces hidden expenses caused by ad-hoc cloud resource usage.  
- **Scalability:** Automated scaling improves availability.  
- **Employer Attractiveness:** Agile processes attract and retain talent.

### Cloud-Native Transformation

Successful transformation requires focus on four key elements: **People, Processes, Technology, Operations**.

#### People

Teams must adopt agile methods, DevOps principles, and automation. Establish a cooperative culture aligned with business objectives.

#### Processes

Adopt design thinking, agile development, and hybrid multi-cloud strategies. Educate leaders and teams to collaborate across the digital product lifecycle.

#### Technology

Develop a comprehensive cloud vision. Choose appropriate hybrid multi-cloud architecture and explore emerging technologies like blockchain and IoT.

#### Operations

Transition from traditional IT to self-service cloud models, moving beyond standard DevOps teams toward a DevOps culture.

## Project Description

We provide partnership in your cloud-native journey, leveraging Red Hat – IBM technologies and expertise. The project spans six months, including analysis, education, implementation, and support.

### Methodology

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate current architecture, team skills, and define a transformation strategy.  
2. **Education:** Develop skill maps and certification programs, covering OpenShift and cloud-native operations.  
3. **Implementation:** Deploy OpenShift platform for container orchestration, integrating with internal teams.  
4. **Support:** Continuous assistance to ensure advanced skills and sustainable adoption.

### Implementation: OpenShift Platform

**Minimum Infrastructure:**

- **3x Master Node**  
- **3x Worker Node**  
- **3x Infra Node**  

- Master nodes provide essential services; Worker nodes run workloads; Infrastructure nodes handle DNS, NFS, DHCP, Load Balancer.  

**Network Requirements:** BASE_DOMAIN, CLUSTER_NAME, IP ranges, ports 80, 443, 6443, 22623.  

**Installation Steps:** Admin node, DHCP/DNS/NFS/Load Balancer setup → Temporary bootstrap node → Master and Worker nodes.


### Resources

OpenShift cluster requires three types of nodes: **Master**, **Worker**, and **Infrastructure/Storage** nodes. Below is the recommended specification for each node type.

#### Master Nodes
Master nodes run the **control plane**, including API server, controller manager, scheduler, and etcd database. These nodes ensure cluster stability, scalability, and high availability.

| Node       | vCPU | RAM  | Storage | NIC | Purpose |
|------------|------|------|---------|-----|---------|
| Master 01  | 4    | 16GB | 120GB   | 1   | API Server, Scheduler, etcd |
| Master 02  | 4    | 16GB | 120GB   | 1   | API Server, Scheduler, etcd |
| Master 03  | 4    | 16GB | 120GB   | 1   | API Server, Scheduler, etcd |

> **Note:** For production clusters, consider increasing RAM to 32GB and adding a second NIC for separate management and data networks.

#### Worker Nodes
Worker nodes host the **application workloads** and microservices. They handle containerized application deployments and autoscaling.

| Node        | vCPU | RAM  | Storage | NIC | Purpose |
|-------------|------|------|---------|-----|---------|
| Worker 01   | 4    | 16GB | 120GB   | 1   | Application workloads |
| Worker 02   | 4    | 16GB | 120GB   | 1   | Application workloads |
| Worker 03   | 4    | 16GB | 120GB   | 1   | Application workloads |

> **Tip:** Add GPU resources if deploying AI/ML workloads.

#### Infrastructure / Storage Nodes
Infrastructure/Storage nodes handle **cluster infrastructure services** such as DNS, DHCP, NFS, Load Balancer, and persistent storage (via OpenShift Data Foundation). These nodes provide reliability for persistent volumes and shared services.

| Node        | vCPU | RAM  | Storage | NIC | Purpose |
|-------------|------|------|---------|-----|---------|
| Infra 01    | 4    | 16GB | 200GB   | 1   | DNS, DHCP, NFS, Load Balancer |
| Infra 02    | 4    | 16GB | 200GB   | 1   | OpenShift Data Foundation, Storage backend |
| Infra 03    | 4    | 16GB | 200GB   | 1   | High-availability storage & backup |

> **Recommendation:** Consider deploying additional storage nodes for **scale-out storage** or **high-performance workloads**.
